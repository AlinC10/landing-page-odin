# Landing Page
This project was made using a design made by The Odin Project. This project is a template that can be slightly modified or used as it is for future webpages.
I will attached a photo of the design that i followed and the instruction that came with it.

# How it was made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS.
I started by doing the whole HTML structure of the page and after I added the CSS. In the CSS I used Flexbox for creating the layout of the page. The font used on the page, with the exception of the quote section, was imported from Google Fonts. The image used is a generic one taken from [Elementor Developers](developers.elementor.com). The image and text can be change for future pages.
